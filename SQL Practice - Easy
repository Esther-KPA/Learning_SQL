1. Query the NAME field for all American cities in the CITY table with populations larger than 120000. The CountryCode for America is USA

SELECT NAME
 FROM CITY
 WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'USA' AND POPULATION > 120000;
 
 *** Adding COUNTRYCODE because there's a need for "ALL american cities"
 
 2. Query all columns (attributes) for every row in the CITY table.
 
  SELECT *
 FROM CITY;
 
 3. Query all columns for a city in CITY with the ID 1661.
 
  SELECT *           
 FROM CITY
 WITH ID 1661;
 
 Corrected Solution:
 SELECT * FROM CITY WHERE ID = 1661; 
 
 4. Query all attributes of every Japanese city in the CITY table. The COUNTRYCODE for Japan is JPN. 
 
  SELECT *
 FROM CITY
 WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'JPN';
 
 5. Query the names of all the Japanese cities in the CITY table. The COUNTRYCODE for Japan is JPN.
 
  SELECT NAME
 FROM CITY
 WHERE COUNTRYCODE = 'JPN';
 
 6. Query a list of CITY and STATE from the STATION table.
 
 SELECT CITY, STATE
FROM STATION;

7. Query a list of CITY names from STATION for cities that have an even ID number. Print the results in any order, but exclude
duplicates from the answer. 


 SELECT CITY
 FROM STATION
 WHERE ID = 'LAT_N'
 
 Corrected solution;
 SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE MOD(ID,2)=0 ORDER BY CITY ASC;   
 
 *** Using DISTINCT because it is used to return only distinct (different) values. MOD() function also returns the remainder of a 
 number divided by another number - So the id number divided by 2 equalling to zero returns an even number 

8. Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name).
If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically. 

When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with the respective lengths 3, 3, 4 and 3. The longest-named city is obviously PQRS, but there are 3 options for shortest-named city; we choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.

SELECT * FROM (SELECT DISTINCT city, LENGTH(city) FROM station ORDER BY LENGTH(city) ASC, city ASC) WHERE ROWNUM = 1   
UNION  
SELECT * FROM (SELECT DISTINCT city, LENGTH(city) FROM station ORDER BY LENGTH(city) DESC, city ASC) WHERE ROWNUM = 1; 

9. Query the list of CITY names starting with vowels (i.e., a, e, i, o, or u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.

SELECT DISTINCT
CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE lower(substr(CITY,1,1)) in ('a','e','i','o','u') ;

10. Query the list of CITY names ending with vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from STATION. Your result cannot contain duplicates.
