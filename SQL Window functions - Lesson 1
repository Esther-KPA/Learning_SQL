### Window functions

NOTE; Sits in the SELECT Clause

Window functions are sometimes confusing to figure out. When exactly do you use them? When are they appropriate over 
aggregate functions? There are two use cases that I’ve experienced where window functions are particularly helpful.

    When you want to measure trends or changes over rows or records in your data.
    When you want to rank a column for outreach or prioritization.

Window functions retain the total number of rows between the input table and the output table (or result). 
Behind the scenes, the window function is able to access more than just the current row of the query result.

When window functions are used, you’ll notice new column names like the following:

    Average running price
    Running total orders
    Running sum sales
    Rank
    Percentile

PostgreSQL’s documentation does an excellent job of introducing the concept of Window Functions.

Note that the naming of these window functions are specific to this course. Most users call all of the functions below “window functions.”

    Partition by: A subclause of the OVER clause. Similar to GROUP BY.
    
    Over: Typically precedes the partition by that signals what to “GROUP BY”.
    
    Aggregates: Aggregate functions that are used in window functions, too (e.g., sum, count, avg).
   
    Row_number(): Ranking function where each row gets a different number.
    
    Rank(): Ranking function where a row could get the same rank if they have the same value.
    
    Dense_rank(): Ranking function similar to rank() but ranks are not skipped with ties.
    
    Aliases: Shorthand that can be used if there are several window functions in one query.
    
    Percentiles: Defines what percentile a value falls into over the entire table.
    
    Lag/Lead: Calculating differences between rows’ values.
    
### CORE Function windows:

- Partition BY
Syntax:
AGGREGATE_FUNCTION (column_1) OVER
 (PARTITION BY column_2 ORDER BY column_3)
  AS new_column_name;
  
 As a reminder, a window function allows users to compare one row to another without doing any joins. Window functions are effective
 when you want to measure trends over time or rank a specific column, and it retains the total number of records without collapsing or
 condensing any of the original datasets.

There are a few key terms to review as a part of understanding core window functions:

    PARTITION BY: A subclause of the OVER clause. I like to think of PARTITION BY as the GROUP BY equivalent in window functions. 
    PARTITION BY allows you to determine what you’d like to “group by” within the window function. Most often, you are partitioning by a month,
    region, etc. as you are tracking changes over time.
    OVER: This syntax signals a window function and precedes the details of the window function itself.

The sequence of Code for Window Functions

Typically, when you are writing a window function that tracks changes or a metric over time, you are likely to structure your syntax with
the following components:

    An aggregation function (e.g., sum, count, or average) + the column you’d like to track
    OVER
    PARTITION BY + the column you’d like to “group by”
    ORDER BY (optional and is often a date column)
    AS + the new column name

We’ll review the key differences between aggregate functions/group by queries and window functions in the next section of this lesson.

This resource from Pinal Dave is helpful.

Exercise 01:
Create a running total of standard_amt_usd (in the orders table) over order time with no date truncation.Your final table should have two 
columns: one with the amount being added for each new row, and a second with the running total.

Solution:
SELECT SUM(standard_amt_usd) OVER 
       (PARTITION BY occurred_at )
       AS running_total, 
       occurred_at
FROM orders

Corrected Solution:
SELECT standard_amt_usd,
       SUM(standard_amt_usd) OVER (ORDER BY occurred_at) AS running_total

FROM orders

Exercise 02:
Now, modify your query from the previous quiz to include partitions. Still create a running total of standard_amt_usd (in the orders table)
over order time, but this time, date truncate occurred_at by year and partition by that same year-truncated occurred_at variable. 

Solution:
SELECT standard_amt_usd,
       DATE_TRUNC('year', occurred_at) as year,
       SUM(standard_amt_usd) OVER (PARTITION BY DATE_TRUNC('year', occurred_at) ORDER BY occurred_at) AS running_total
FROM orders

### GROUP BY VS WINDOW FUNCTIONS

Example 01:

SELECT order_id,
       order_total,
       order_price,
       SUM(order_total) OVER
           (PARTITION BY month(order_date) ORDER BY order_date) AS running_monthly_sales,
       COUNT(order_id) OVER
           (PARTITION BY month(order_date) ORDER BY order_date) AS running_monthly orders,
       AVG(order_price) OVER
           (PARTITION BY month(order_date) ORDER BY order_date) AS average_monthly_price
FROM  amazon_sales_db
WHERE order_date < '2017-01-01';

#### AGGREGATES VS WINDOW FUNCTIONS

Example 01:

SELECT id,
       account_id,
       standard_qty,
       DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) AS month,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at)) AS dense_rank,
       SUM(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at)) AS sum_standard_qty,
       COUNT(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at)) AS count_standard_qty,
       AVG(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at)) AS avg_standard_qty,
       MIN(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at)) AS min_standard_qty,
       MAX(standard_qty) OVER (PARTITION BY account_id ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at)) AS max_standard_qty
FROM orders

*** What is happening when you omit the ORDER BY clause when doing aggregates with window functions

Removing ORDER BY just leaves an unordered partition; in our query's case, each column's value is simply an aggregation 
(e.g., sum, count, average, minimum, or maximum) of all the standard_qty values in its respective account_id.

As Stack Overflow user mathguy explains:

    The easiest way to think about this - leaving the ORDER BY out is equivalent to "ordering" in a way that all rows in the partition are
    "equal" to each other. Indeed, you can get the same effect by explicitly adding the ORDER BY clause like this: ORDER BY 0 (or "order by" 
    any constant expression), or even, more emphatically, ORDER BY NULL.
