### Null

Example 01;

SELECT *
FROM accounts
WHERE primary_poc IS NOT NULL

### Count

Example 01;

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM accounts;


Example 02;
SELECT COUNT(accounts.id)
FROM accounts;

NB: These two examples give equivalent result values.

Example 03;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
WHERE occurred_at >= '2016-12-01'
AND occurred_at < '2017-01-01'

NB: With an Alias as Order_count ie Name of table with totale number of rows

Example 04;

SELECT COUNT (id) AS account_id_count
FROM accounts


### SUM

Example 01;

SELECT SUM(standard_qty) AS standard,
       SUM(gloss_qty) AS gloss,
       SUM(poster_qty) AS poster
       
       
       Exercise 01;
       
       Find the total amount of poster_qty paper ordered in the orders table.
       
       Solution;
       SELECT SUM(poster_qty) AS total_poster_sales
       FROM orders;
       
       Find the total amount of standard_qty paper ordered in the orders table.
       
       Solution;
       SELECT SUM(standard_qty) AS total_standard_sales
       FROM orders;
       
       Find the total dollar amount of sales using the total_amt_usd in the orders table.
       
       Solution;
       SELECT SUM(total_amt_usd) AS total_dollar_sales
       FROM orders;       

       Find the total amount spent on standard_amt_usd and gloss_amt_usd paper for each order in the orders table. 
       This should give a dollar amount for each order in the table.
       
       Solution;
       SELECT SUM(standard_amt_usd) AS standard
       SUM(gloss_amt_usd) AS gloss
       FROM orders;
       
       Corrected solution;
       SELECT standard_amt_usd + gloss_amt_usd AS total_standard_gloss
       FROM orders;
       
       Find the standard_amt_usd per unit of standard_qty paper. Your solution should use both aggregation and a mathematical operator.
       
       Solution;
       SELECT SUM(standard_amt_usd/standard_qty) AS standard          
       FROM orders;

       Corrected solution;
       SELECT SUM(standard_amt_usd)/SUM(standard_qty) AS standard_price_per_unit
       FROM orders;
       
       
### MIN & MAX

Example 01;

SELECT MIN(standard_qty) AS standard_min,
       MIN(gloss_qty) AS gloss_min,
       MIN(poster_qty) AS poster_min,
       MAX(standard_qty) AS standard_max,
       MAX(gloss_qty) AS gloss_max,
       MAX(poster_qty) AS poster_max
FROM   orders

NB: Here we were simultaneously obtaining the MIN and MAX number of orders of each paper type. However, you could run each individually.

### AVERAGE ; AVG

Example 01;

SELECT AVG(standard_qty) AS standard_avg,
       AVG(gloss_qty) AS gloss_avg,
       AVG(poster_qty) AS poster_avg
FROM orders

Exercise:

01 ;;
When was the earliest order ever placed? You only need to return the date.

Solution:
SELECT MAX(occurred_at) AS earliest_order_placed
FROM orders;

Corrected solution:
SELECT MIN(occurred_at) 
FROM orders;


02;;

Try performing the same query as in question 1 without using an aggregation function. 

Solution:

SELECT occurred_at
FROM orders
WHERE occurred_at DESC;

Corrected solution:
SELECT occurred_at 
FROM orders 
ORDER BY occurred_at
LIMIT 1;

03;;
When did the most recent (latest) web_event occur?

Solution:
SELECT MAX(occurred_at) AS latest_web_event
FROM web_events;

04;;

 Try to perform the result of the previous query without using an aggregation function.
 
 Solution:
 SELECT occurred_at
FROM web_events
ORDER BY occurred_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

05;;

Find the mean (AVERAGE) amount spent per order on each paper type, as well as the mean amount of each paper type purchased 
per order. Your final answer should have 6 values - one for each paper type for the average number of sales, as well as 
the average amount

Solution:
SELECT AVG(standard_qty) mean_standard, AVG(gloss_qty) mean_gloss, 
        AVG(poster_qty) mean_poster, AVG(standard_amt_usd) mean_standard_usd, 
        AVG(gloss_amt_usd) mean_gloss_usd, AVG(poster_amt_usd) mean_poster_usd
FROM orders;

06;;

the MEDIAN total_usd spent on all orders? 

Solution:
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT total_amt_usd
   FROM orders
   ORDER BY total_amt_usd
   LIMIT 3457) AS Table1
ORDER BY total_amt_usd DESC
LIMIT 2;
