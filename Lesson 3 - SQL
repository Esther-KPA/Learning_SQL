### AND & BETWEEN

Solution:

SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE standard_qty > 1000 AND poster_qty=0 AND gloss-qty=0;

/*
When you use the BETWEEN operator in SQL, do the results include the values of your endpoints, or not? 
Figure out the answer to this important question by writing a query that displays the order date 
and gloss_qty data for all orders where gloss_qty is between 24 and 29. Then look at your output to see if the BETWEEN operator 
included the begin and end values or not.  */

Solution:

SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE occurred_at 'gloss_qty' BETWEEN 24 AND 29;

           AND ((primary_poc LIKE '%ana%' OR primary_poc LIKE '%Ana%') 
           AND primary_poc NOT LIKE '%eana%');
